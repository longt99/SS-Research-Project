# Overview of Week 1

The first few days were spent reading through papers and going through SunPy examples. After meeting on Wednesday, got STIXpy working and started going through the material provided by Brendan. Spent a good bit of time on Wed/Thur going through the SWW Tutorials. Then, using both Brendan's code and code from tutorials, started to make some (rough) plots of data from a few different instruments for a specific day (07-09-2021):
* SWAVES
* GOES
* STIX
* I-LOFAR
* WIND (attempted but issue with file type)
* Summary Plot with GOES + STIX + SWAVES
